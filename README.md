Tried problem statement 2 - Inventory Management system - 
Created using SpringBoot and Java.
Made list for inventory, with predefined Product items in the list, hard code in service class.
Customers and products are hard code, they have to be defined for each instance and they dont last after instance ends.
Created Product class to define each item in model package.
Implemented adding and removing items from inventory services, as well as adding items to cart.
Discount endpoint is giving as wrong output.
Product,Customer and Discount have been defined in Model package.
Controller class has API endpoints
Have added json file of postman collection.
